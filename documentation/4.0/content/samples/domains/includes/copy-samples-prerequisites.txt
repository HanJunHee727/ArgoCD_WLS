1. Choose the type of domain you're going to use throughout the sample, `WLS` or `JRF`.

1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 or 11 installation.

1. Get the operator source and put it in `/tmp/weblogic-kubernetes-operator`.

   For example:

   ```shell
   $ cd /tmp
   ```
   ```shell
   $ git clone --branch v{{< latestVersion >}} https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git
   ```

   **Note**: We will refer to the top directory of the operator source tree as `/tmp/weblogic-kubernetes-operator`; however, you can use a different location.

   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).
